With modern architectures such as serverless and microservices, the number of resources managed in the cloud tends to increase, making monitoring a challenging task. `alarm-craft` is a tool designed to address this problem.

## Features

- **Bulk Generation**: Generates the necessary monitoring alarms in bulk with a single command.
- **Flexible Alarm Definition**: Allows flexible definition of alarm conditions, including metrics and thresholds.
- **Declarative Config**: Provides [declarative configurations](https://github.com/alarm-craft/alarm-craft/wiki/ConfigurationByExample) for monitoring targets using resource name or tag.
- **Integration with Your Deployment Pipeline**: A CLI tool written in Python that can be seamlessly [integrated](https://github.com/alarm-craft/alarm-craft/wiki/Automation) into the deployment pipeline.
- **DevOps**: By leveraging declarative configurations based on the tag strategy and integrating `alarm-craft` with the deployment pipeline, DevOps teams can automatically monitor newly deployed resources.

## Quick Start

1. Install python (>= 3.9), and install `alarm-craft`.
   ```bash
   pip install alarm-craft
   ```
1. Create a json file like below and save it as `alarm-config.yaml`
   ```yaml
   resources:
     lambda:
       target_resource_type: "lambda:function"
       alarm:
         metrics:
           - Errors
   ```
1. Execute the tool.
   ```bash
   alarm-craft
   ```
   By this execution, the `alarm-craft` creates Cloudwatch Alarms to detect `Errors` in all Lambda functions.
